Autopilot Documentation
=======================

Autopilot is a tool developed by FRC team 3414, designed to act as a powerful
solution for autonomous robot control.

Check out :doc:`about` to learn all the features of Autopilot and why it may
(or may not) be the solution for your team.

.. note:: This is currently a Java-only library. There's a port to C++
   `here <https://github.com/DanPeled/AutopilotCPP>`_, which isn't *officialy*
   supported, but it should be similar nonetheless.
